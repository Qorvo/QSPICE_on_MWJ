= Qorvo's QSPICE Example: P-FET LDO Open / Closed Loop PSRR with Intentional Line Regulation

== Overview
This p-FET LDO model illustrates that a PSRR curve at low frequency region is converging to its DC parameter "line regulation".

Both PSRR and DC-parameter-Line-Regulation share the same expression / definition:

PSRR = Line-Regulation = ƒ¢Vout / ƒ¢Vin

In many regulator devices, its refernece voltage source "VREF" is depending on its supply voltage and that tiny drift of VREF is captured as line-regulation or PSRR of low frequency.

== Note
This is a p-FET LDO model.
The control of p-FET is "negative direction", that means the error amp "+" and "-" working in opposite way.
Though the feedback signal from Rfb // Rg goes into the "+" port, this forms a "negative feedback loop".
