= Qorvo's QSPICE Example: P-FET LDO PSRR with LDO ON / OFF

== Overview

This p-FET LDO model compares its PSRR curves with conditions "LDO ON" and "LDO OFF" from the post https://www.microwavejournal.com/blogs/32-rf-signal-integrity-to-power-integrity/post/tbd[TBD] of a series blog/article https://www.microwavejournal.com/blogs/32-rf-signal-integrity-to-power-integrity[RF Signal Integrity to Power Integrity] on https://www.microwavejournal.com/[Microwave Journal].

The key point of this simulation is to illustrate the behind power/engine of VRM PSRR performance comes from the error-amp (EA).  As this EA's bandwidth fading at high frequency, the PSRR curve is identical to the output capacitor.

== Note
This is a p-FET LDO model.
The control of p-FET is "negative direction", that means the error amp "+" and "-" working in opposite way.
Though the feedback signal from Rfb // Rg goes into the "+" port, this forms a "negative feedback loop".

* We start from the schematic capture **VRM_PSRR_OnOff.qsch**. +
  For your convenience, we converted the schematic into the image file **VRM_PSRR_OnOff_sch.png**.

* On the QSPICE GUI, we convert the schematic into the netlist **VRM_PSRR_OnOff.cir**.
* By executing the Python script **VRM_PSRR_OnOff.py**, we run the QSPICE from the netlist. +
  We need the Python library file **qspice.py** in this directory.
* The QSPICE results in the output waveform plot **VRM_PSRR_OnOff_plt.png**.
